# Status JSON Documentation

This document describes the public `status.json` endpoint for the BijbelQuiz status site.

**Endpoint**
- `https://status.bijbelquiz.app/status.json`

**Purpose**
- Provide a machine-readable snapshot of current service health.
- Show only currently active events.
- Offer lightweight integration for monitoring and status widgets.

**Response**
- Content-Type: `application/json`
- Cache-Control: `no-store`
- Always computed on request.

**Top-level fields**
- `status`: Overall health. One of `operational`, `degraded`, `major`.
- `title`: Human label for `status`.
- `summary`: Short description. Can be empty when fully operational.
- `updatedAt`: ISO-8601 timestamp when the snapshot was generated.
- `windowDays`: Rolling window size for uptime calculation.
- `uptimePercent`: Uptime percentage for the window, rounded to 3 decimals.
- `events`: Array of active events only. Empty when there are no ongoing events.

**Event fields**
- `id`: Event identifier.
- `title`: Event title.
- `description`: Event description.
- `type`: `incident` or `maintenance`.
- `severity`: `minor`, `major`, or `critical`.
- `status`: Event status. Currently `ongoing` for all returned events.
- `impact`: `app` or `website`.
- `startsAt`: ISO-8601 timestamp for start time.
- `endsAt`: ISO-8601 timestamp for end time or `null` if not set.

**Notes**
- Only active events are included in `events`.
- If there are no active events, `events` is an empty array.
- `summary` can be an empty string when all systems are operational.
- If `impact` was not set on older events, it defaults to `app` in the API.
