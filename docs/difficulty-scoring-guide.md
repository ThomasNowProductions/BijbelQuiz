# Difficulty Scoring Guide for Bible Quiz Questions

This guide provides clear criteria for assigning difficulty scores (1-5) to Bible quiz questions to ensure consistency across the question database.

## Scoring Scale

### Score 1: Very Easy
**Criteria:**
- Basic biblical knowledge that most people learn in childhood
- Well-known stories from Genesis, Jesus' life, or popular biblical events

### Score 3: Medium
**Criteria:**
- Requires some familiarity with specific biblical passages
- Less obvious details from well-known stories
- Knowledge of biblical concepts or teachings

- Some numbers or specific details that aren't widely known

**Examples:**
- "How old was Abraham when Isaac was born?" (100)
- "What was the name of Abram's father?" (Terah)
- "What promise follows 'blessed are the pure in heart'?"
- "Where did Moses strike the rock?" (at Meribah)

### Score 4: Hard
**Criteria:**
- Specific details from less frequently studied passages
- Knowledge of secondary events or supporting characters
- Requires understanding context or implications

### Score 5: Very Hard
**Criteria:**
- Obscure details from any part of the Bible
- Prophetic or apocalyptic imagery/symbolism
- Specific quotations or exact phrasing
- Details from minor prophets or challenging passages
- Requires deep textual knowledge or study
- Complex theological concepts

**Examples:**
- "Which prophet was not allowed to marry by the Lord?" (Jeremiah)

- "How is the holy city called in Ezekiel 48?" ("The Lord is there")
- "What did Hannah NOT bring with her when she brought Samuel to Eli?" (2 measures of barley)

## Additional Considerations

### Factors that Increase Difficulty:
1. **Obscure biblical references** - lesser-known books or passages
2. **Specific numbers/dates** - exact ages, quantities, time periods
3. **Prophetic literature** - symbolic or metaphorical language
4. **Negative questions** - "Which of these did NOT happen"
5. **Exact quotations** - precise wording requirements
6. **Secondary characters** - supporting rather than main figures
7. **Geographic specificity** - exact locations rather than general regions

### Factors that Decrease Difficulty:
1. **Major biblical figures** - Jesus, Moses, David, Paul
2. **Familiar narratives** - Christmas, Easter, Exodus
3. **Repetition in scripture** - concepts mentioned multiple times
4. **Cultural familiarity** - stories taught in Sunday school
5. **Simple factual recall** - straightforward information

## Question Type Considerations

### Multiple Choice (mc)
- Wrong answers can make questions harder (confusing distractors increase difficulty)
- Obvious wrong answers make questions easier

### Fill in the Blank (fitb)
- Generally harder than multiple choice (no answer options)
- Specific phrasing requirements increase difficulty

## Review Process

When scoring new questions:
1. Consider the target audience's likely biblical knowledge
2. Check if similar questions have been scored before for consistency
3. Consider whether the answer requires general knowledge or specific study
4. Factor in the biblical reference (common vs. obscure passages)
5. Review wrong answer options for multiple choice questions

Remember: The goal is to create a balanced quiz that challenges participants while remaining fair and educational.
