# BijbelQuiz App Improvement Plan

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive improvements for the BijbelQuiz Flutter application based on a thorough code analysis. The suggestions are organized by priority with implementation timelines.


## 🔧 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Architecture & Performance

### Refactoring
- **Split large classes**:
  - Break down `QuizScreen` (1457 lines) into smaller components:
    - Extract timer management to `QuizTimerManager`
    - Extract animation logic to `QuizAnimationController`
    - Extract PQU algorithm to `ProgressiveQuestionSelector`
    - Extract answer handling to `QuizAnswerHandler`
- **Extract helper methods**:
  - Move responsive grid calculations to `lib/utils/responsive_utils.dart`
  - Create `lib/utils/theme_utils.dart` for theme switching logic
  - Extract common widget patterns to reusable components
- **Simplify complex logic**:
  - Refactor repetitive theme switching in `main.dart`
  - Simplify the 4 concurrent animation controllers in QuizScreen

### Performance Optimizations
- **Optimize memory usage**:
  - QuestionCacheService loads full questions unnecessarily
  - Implement metadata-only caching for better memory efficiency
  - Reduce memory cache size from 50 to 25 for very low-end devices
- **Improve loading performance**:
  - Implement proper pagination instead of loading all questions at once
  - Add background loading for next question batches
  - Optimize LRU cache eviction strategy
- **Reduce animation complexity**:
  - Combine multiple animation controllers where possible
  - Use single controller with multiple tweens
  - Implement frame rate adaptive animations

## 🎯 MEDIUM PRIORITY - User Experience

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Add loading states**:
  - Implement skeleton screens for lesson grids
  - Add progress indicators for question loading
  - Show loading feedback during answer processing
- **Improve error handling**:
  - Add retry mechanisms for failed question loads
  - Implement graceful degradation for network failures
  - Add user-friendly error messages with actionable steps
- **Enhance accessibility**:
  - Add more semantic labels and screen reader support
  - Improve keyboard navigation
  - Add focus management for screen readers
  - Implement proper heading hierarchy

### Game Features
- **Add practice mode improvements**:
  - Allow category-specific practice sessions
  - Add unlimited practice mode without progress tracking
  - Implement question history to avoid immediate repeats
- **Implement streak rewards**:
  - Visual feedback for consecutive correct answers
  - Streak milestone celebrations
  - Streak protection mechanisms
- **Add question difficulty indicators**:
  - Show difficulty level (1-5 stars) for each question
  - Allow difficulty-based filtering
  - Provide difficulty progression feedback

## ✨ LOW PRIORITY - New Features

### Gamification
- **Achievements system**:
  - Unlock badges for milestones (100 questions answered, perfect lesson, etc.)
  - Achievement progress tracking
  - Achievement showcase in profile/settings
- **Daily challenges**:
  - Time-limited special question sets
  - Daily streak rewards
  - Challenge completion certificates
- **Leaderboards**:
  - Local high scores and statistics tracking
  - Category-specific leaderboards
  - Historical performance charts

### Content & Learning
- **Question categories**:
  - Allow filtering by biblical books or topics
  - Category-based lesson creation
  - Cross-category question mixing
- **Progress visualization**:
  - Better charts showing improvement over time
  - Learning curve analytics
  - Weak area identification
- **Study mode**:
  - Non-timed mode for learning without pressure
  - Answer explanations and biblical references
  - Bookmark difficult questions for review

### Technical Enhancements
- **Offline support**:
  - Cache questions for offline play
  - Offline progress synchronization
  - Reduced data usage mode
- **Multi-language support**:
  - Expand beyond Dutch (English, German, French)
  - RTL language support preparation
  - Localized question content
- **Data export/import**:
  - Allow users to backup their progress
  - Cross-device synchronization
  - Data migration between app versions
