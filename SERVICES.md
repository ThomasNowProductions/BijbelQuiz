## Service Architecture

### Dependency Injection

Services are typically instantiated at the app level and passed down through the widget tree or accessed via Provider:

```dart
// In main.dart or app initialization
final soundService = SoundService();
final quizSoundService = QuizSoundService(soundService);

// Make services available via Provider
runApp(
  MultiProvider(
    providers: [
      Provider<SoundService>.value(value: soundService),
      Provider<QuizSoundService>.value(value: quizSoundService),
    ],
    child: MyApp(),
  ),
);
```

### Error Handling

All services include comprehensive error handling:

- Try-catch blocks around critical operations
- Graceful degradation when services fail
- Logging of errors for debugging
- User-friendly error messages when appropriate

### Testing

Services are designed to be easily testable:

- Dependency injection allows for mock services
- Pure functions where possible
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error scenarios covered

## Best Practices

1. **Single Responsibility:** Each service has one primary responsibility
2. **Dependency Injection:** Services receive dependencies rather than creating them
3. **Error Handling:** All services handle errors gracefully
4. **Logging:** Important operations are logged for debugging
5. **Performance:** Services consider performance impact on low-end devices
6. **Testing:** Services are designed to be easily unit tested

## Future Enhancements

- Service health monitoring
- Automatic service restart on failure
- Service performance metrics
- Enhanced caching strategies
- Background service synchronization
