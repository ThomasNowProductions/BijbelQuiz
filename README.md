### Design Patterns

- **Provider Pattern**: State management for reactive UI updates
- **Service Layer**: Separation of business logic from UI
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Factory Pattern**: Object creation for models
- **Observer Pattern**: Event handling and notifications

### Key Components

#### Progressive Question Up-selection (PQU)
The app uses an intelligent difficulty adjustment algorithm that:
- Analyzes user performance across multiple metrics
- Adjusts question difficulty dynamically
- Prevents getting stuck at the same difficulty level
- Balances challenge with achievability

#### Performance Optimization
- **Frame Rate Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cache optimization
- **Adaptive Animations**: Duration adjustment based on device capabilities
- **Lazy Loading**: Progressive question loading to reduce startup time

#### Offline-First Design
- **Question Caching**: Local storage of question data
- **Background Sync**: Automatic data updates when online
- **Graceful Degradation**: Full functionality without network

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Working

If you're not receiving daily motivation notifications:

**Android:**
1. **App Settings**: Ensure notifications are enabled in app settings
2. **System Permissions**: Check notification permissions in device settings
3. **Android 12+**: Enable "Schedule exact alarms" permission
4. **Battery Optimization**: Disable battery optimization for the app
5. **Background Execution**: Allow background execution in battery settings

**iOS:**
1. **System Settings**: Enable notifications for the app
2. **Focus Modes**: Check if notifications are blocked by Focus/DND modes
3. **Background Refresh**: Ensure background app refresh is enabled

**General:**
1. **Restart App**: Force stop and restart the application
2. **Check Time Zone**: Verify device time zone is correct
3. **Network**: Ensure device has internet for initial setup

### Performance Issues

**Low Frame Rate:**
- The app automatically detects low-end devices and adjusts animations
- Try restarting the app to reset performance monitoring
- Check for background apps consuming resources

**Slow Loading:**
- Clear app cache in device settings
- Ensure stable internet connection for initial data load
- Try restarting the app

**Memory Issues:**
- The app includes automatic memory optimization
- Restart the app if memory usage seems high
- Check available device storage

### Audio Problems

**No Sound Effects:**
- Check if sound is muted in app settings
- Verify device volume is not muted
- For Linux: Install audio players (mpg123, ffplay)

**Audio Playback Errors:**
- Try restarting the app
- Check system audio configuration
- For Linux: Verify audio drivers are working
